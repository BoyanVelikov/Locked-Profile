Project from JavaScript Developer Professional Program - Course 5 - 04.2022-05.2022 - SoftUni Global

To start the server, run the included start.bat file, or manually open a command prompt and execute the node server.js command.

A JS project that shows and hides the additional information about users. When one of the [Show more] buttons is clicked, the hidden information will be displayed only if the profile is not locked.

If the current profile is locked, nothing will happen.

If the hidden information is displayed and we lock the profile again, the [Hide it] button doesn't work.

Otherwise, when the profile is unlocked and we click on the [Hide it] button, the new fields will be hidden again.
